#Info
This is a simple terminal chat program made using pthreads and sockets, it is rough around the edges but showcases my use of C

#Instructions
! character typed by itself terminates the program for the user that typed it
(can type hello! and such without killing program)

make to compile (used provided list.o and list.h in assignment)

make clean to remove s-talk

To initiate chat type ./s-talk [port #] [remote machine name] [remote port #]. Do this in two different termianls to see it in action locally

#Additional Info
Some things in this assignment were not implemented correctly but overall I learned alot and took away some valuable lessons from this. Uploading for showcasing purposes.
